# Online Decision Making via Stochastic Gradient Descent

Python implementation of Statistical Inference for Online Decision Making via Stochastic Gradient Descent

The main class for fitting the reward model and making decisions is in `ODMSGD.py`. The `simulation_` files are used to render the numerical results in the paper. Check out the `ODMSGD-Example.ipynb` notebook for what you can do with the `ODMSGD` class.
